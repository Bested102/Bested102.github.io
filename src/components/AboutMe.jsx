      <p>
        Hello, I&apos;m Omar. I&apos;m a front-end developer with a strong
        foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Since I began learning to
        code in February 2023, I&apos;ve expanded my skillset to include
        popular front-end techs like Vue.js and React. I&apos;m always eager to learn
        new technologies and stay up-to-date with the latest advancements
        in web development to provide engaging and user-friendly websites.
